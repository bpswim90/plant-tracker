# plant-tracker / GreenHouse

**GreenHouse** is a CRUD web application that allows the user to keep track of when their houseplants were last watered. 

## Why? 

I love keeping houseplants but tend to forget about them, and either water them too much or too little. I also lose track of which plants like to be watered, and which don't. The application remembers all this information and reminds me when to take the proper action, to keep my plants happy.

## How it works.

Users begin by creating a new Plant Type, where they can specify the type of plant, how often it likes to be watered, as well as its light preference. They can then create an instance of this plant to add to their "My Plants" collection. Once a plant has been added to "My Plants", the user simply clicks the "Water" button next to a plant whenever they water it and the application will keep track of when it was last watered and when it needs to be watered next.

## Technologies involved.

* Java with Spring Boot, Hibernate and MySQL on the backend
* HTML/CSS and Bootstrap for some level of responsiveness on the frontend

## Other notes. 

After completing LaunchCode's LC101 class, I built this project to practice some of the Java skills I learned in the class as well as experiment with BootStrap.
